### Unity/Python Developer
---
>Hi, im Denys, i have around ~3 years of commercial experience and published products such as Android/IOS games, VR/AR business projecs and PC educational programs. Im confident with C#/Python and got a deep knowledge of Unity Engine. Trying as hard as possible to get the code look more clarified by following SOLID principles and more scalable by following OOP paradigms. Learning quickly by researching a lot and studying off the work, I’m interested in complex problems and finding a common language with colleagues. I’m also familiar and regularly using Trello, Jira, Basecamp, Git-version control. Motivated, result-oriented with high level of problem-solving capabilities.
